This project was completed using Node.js and several NPM packages that are detailed in the package.json file.
You can also view my commands.txt file for package information. My development environment was Cloud9 and I 
used Node.js through the Express.js framework to design the 7 RESTful routes to create an application that 
allows users to post their favorite restaurants (name, image, description). Each posted restaurant has its 
own show page (restaurant/:id) where users can go to view the restaurant's description and comments as well
as leave a comment. The app also has a user authentication system and posts/comments are linked to the 
relevant user. MongoDB is used for all database-related mumbo-jumbos such as storing posts, comments, and 
other user-related information.

All technologies involved:

IDE: Cloud9
